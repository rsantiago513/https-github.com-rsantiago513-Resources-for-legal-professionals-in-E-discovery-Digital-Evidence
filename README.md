# E-discovery and Digital Evidence resources for legal professionals 

Electronic discovery (E-Discovery) refers to discovery in legal proceedings such as litigation, government investigations, or Freedom of Information Act requests, where the information sought is in electronic format often referred to as electronically stored information. Electronic discovery is subject to rules of civil procedure and agreed-upon processes, often involving review for privilege and relevance before data are turned over to the requesting party. Electronic information is considered different from paper information because of its intangible form, volume, transience and persistence. Electronic information is usually accompanied by metadata that is not found in paper documents and that can play an important part as evidence, for example, the date and time a document was written could be useful in a copyright case. The preservation of metadata from electronic documents creates special challenges to prevent spoliation.

Computer forensics is its own brand of forensics using investigative processes to collect, analyze and present digital evidence for legal proceedings. Sometimes called ''cyber forensics,'' these digital and computer-based techniques can often provide the evidence necessary to solve a crime. Computer forensics experts use a variety of software and other applications to retrieve, identify and extract data, even data that has been hidden or deleted, and then offer their report or interpretation of the data collected. Digital evidence on computers can be challenging to work with. While some of it may be visible, a good portion of a computer forensic expert's work is involved in discovering latent or hidden data inside a computer's systems. Whether out in the open or hidden, the process of computer forensics is the same: collect, analyze and present the digital data discovered.

E-Discovery can be a complicated and overwhelming task. Data evidence must not only be collected, but also be acquired in a manner that validates the data's authentication in court. Specialized software tools are available that help with collecting, sorting, and producing relevant data. Although digital forensics tools and E-Discovery tools have manny common features, they are designed for different purposes. Digital forensics tools are designed to collect data in a manner that retains crucial file information so that data can be validated and used in court. These tools perform functions in these major categories: Acquisition, Validation and Discrimination, Extraction, Reconstruction, and Reporting. Not all of these functions are needed for E-Discovery. E-Discovery tools are designed to analyzed data that has not been deleted and search for files and other information that could be relevant in a case. 

Digital forensics tools are used to capture hard drive images as part of the duty to preserve. They can also be used to mount forensic images in read-only mode so that other tools can be used to extract or search for relevant data. In addition, they can identify deleted foles, registry entries, and partial files and carve through a hard drive's free space to find file and data fragment. Although digital forensics tools are designed to collect data in a manner that retains crucial file information so that data can be validated and used in court, the process an examiner uses to extract relevant data is equally important. Many digital forensics and E-Discovery tools offer activity logging to capture the examiner's actions when using the software. Activity logging creates a record of the examiner's actions as well as system activities and events. When evidence items are added or searches are created or modified, the activity log records these events and places timestamps in the log file. This log can be used to review search settings and summaries of search result.
