# E-discovery and Digital Evidence resources for legal professionals 

E-Discovery can be a complicated and overwhelming task. Data evidence must not only be collected, but also be acquired in a manner that validates the data's authentication in court. Specialized software tools are available that help with collecting, sorting, and producing relevant data. Although digital forensics tools and E-Discovery tools have manny common features, they are designed for different purposes. Digital forensics tools are designed to collect data in a manner that retains crucial file information so that data can be validated and used in court. These tools perform functions in these major categories: Acquisition, Validation and Discrimination, Extraction, Reconstruction, and Reporting. Not all of these functions are needed for E-Discovery. E-Discovery tools are designed to analyzed data that has not been deleted and search for files and other information that could be relevant in a case.
